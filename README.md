# Bilevel Optimization with a Multi-Objective Lower-Level Problem: Optimistic, Risk-Neutral, and Risk-Averse Implementations

This is the numerical implementation accompanying the paper "Bilevel Optimization with a Multi-Objective Lower-Level Problem: Risk-Neutral and Risk-Averse Formulations". Please refer to the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05540) for more details.

## 1. Software Requirements

The code was implemented in Python 3.9 and requires the following libraries:

+ numpy
+ torch
+ torchvision
+ sklearn
+ scipy
+ time
+ random
+ os
+ copy
+ pandas
